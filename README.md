# Coding Challenges in JS

Here is a set of coding challenges that I took, on a day when I was bored, sources vary.

## Matrix Layer Rotation (Hard)

Challange found on `hackerrank.com`

You are given a 2D matrix, a, of dimension MxN and a positive integer R. You have to rotate the matrix R times and print the resultant matrix. Rotation should be in anti-clockwise direction.

## Extra Long Factorials (Medium)

Challange found on `hackerrank.com`

The factorial of the integer n, written n!, is defined as:
n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

## Climbing the Leaderboard (Medium)

Challange found on `hackerrank.com`

Alice is playing an arcade game and wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and wants to track her ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:
* The player with the highest score is ranked number  on the leaderboard.
* Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.

For example, the four players on the leaderboard have high scores of 100, 90, 90 and 80. Those players will have ranks 1, 2, 2, and 3, respectively. If Alice's scores are 70, 80 and 105, her rankings after each game are 4th, 3rd and 1st.

## Find longest common subsequence (Easy)

Found on Youtube: `youtube.comwatch?v=10WnvBk9sZc`

Write a function that takes two strings, s1 and s2 and returns the longest common subsequence of s1 and s2.

## Sock Merchant (Easy)

Challange found on `hackerrank.com`

John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are. 

For example, there are n=7 socks with colors ar=[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]. There is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.

## FizzBuzz (Easy)

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

# Instructions:

`npm install` to install all packages, `npm test` to run tests
